elk for Debian
--------------

New location of files in Debian GNU/Linux version of Elk:
---------------------------------------------------------

	The default install location of files and directories in the
Elk distribution does not comply with the FSSTND. This is the reason 
why some reordering has been done for the Debian packaged version. 
	However the documentation has not been changed. All relative
and absolute paths referred therein are the original.
	The following table relates the original locations to the new ones:

	Original location		New location
	.................		............

$install_dir/bin/scheme			/usr/bin/scheme

$install_dir/include/			/usr/include/elk/

$install_dir/runtime/{scm,obj}/		/usr/lib/elk/{scm,obj}/

$install_dir/lib/*.o			/usr/lib/elk/*.o

$install_dir/lib/{linkscheme,makedl}	/usr/bin/{linkscheme,makedl}

$install_dir/lib/ldflags		/usr/bin/ldflags-elk
