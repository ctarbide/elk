This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the Extension Language Kit,
an Scheme implementation.
Elk was written by Oliver Laumann <net@informatik.uni-bremen.de>.

This package was put together by me, Enrique Zanardi
<ezanardi@molec1.dfis.ull.es>, from sources obtained from:
ftp://ftp.uni-bremen.de/pub/programming/languages/scheme/elk/elk-3.0.tar.gz

Changes:
  * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
  * added config/system file with Linux-ELF specific information for
    the Makefiles.
  * modified config/site to look for the X libs and includes at the right 
    place.
  * modified */.../build* and config/site scripts to obtain FSSTND 
    compliant installation. The new locations of the files are listed in 
    addendum.txt 
  * modified src/dump-elf.c as suggested in Elk-News web page to avoid
    a "syms.h include file not found" compile-time error. (Just deleted
    the "#include <syms.h>" line).
